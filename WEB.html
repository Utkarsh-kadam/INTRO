<a  href="https://www.javatpoint.com/what-is-world-wide-web" style="color: white">Web</a> is network of large amount of data stored in different servers. 
Web is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators, which may be interlinked by hyperlinks, and are accessible over the Internet. 
a subset of the Internet consisting of the pages that can be accessed by a Web browser is web. 
Users can access the content of these sites from any part of the world over the internet using their devices such as computers. 
The building blocks of the Web are web pages which are formatted in HTML and connected by links called "hypertext" or hyperlinks and accessed by HTTP.

<h1 align = "center"> What is client and server? </h1>
<hr width ="40%">
<font size ="5">
<a  href="https://www.omnisci.com/technical-glossary/client-server" style="color: white">Server</a> is high power computer that is built to store, process and manage data. Server are used to provide functionality to the clients. 
<br>

<a  href="https://www.omnisci.com/technical-glossary/client-server" style="color: white">Client</a> are computer hardware or software program that are used to access the data on server and communicate with servers 
The client-server model, or client-server architecture, is a distributed application framework dividing tasks between servers and clients, which either reside in the same system or communicate through a computer network or the Internet. 
The client relies on sending a request to another program in order to access a service made available by a server. 
The server runs one or more programs that share resources with and distribute work among clients.

<h1 align = "center">What is frontend and backend? </h1>
<hr width ="50%">
<br>
<font size ="5">
<a  href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/frontend-vs-backend/" style="color: white">Front end development</a> is programming which focuses on the visual elements of a website or app that a user will interact with (the client side). 
The part of a website that the user interacts with directly is termed the front end. 
It is also referred to as the ‘client side’ of the application. It includes everything that users experience directly: text colors and styles, images, graphs and tables, buttons, colors, and navigation menu. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the languages used for Front End development.
<br>
<a  href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/frontend-vs-backend/" style="color: white">Back end development</a> focuses on the side of the website users can’t see. It’s what makes a site interactive. The back end can also be referred to as the “server side” of a website.
Backend is the server-side of the website. It stores and arranges data, and also makes sure everything on the client-side of the website works fine. 
It is the part of the website that you cannot see and interact with. It is the portion of software that does not come in direct contact with the users. 
The parts and characteristics developed by backend designers are indirectly accessed by users through a front-end application. Activities, like writing APIs, creating libraries, and working with system components without user interfaces or even systems of scientific programming, are also included in the backend.

<h1 align = "center">How does a surfer find a web server? </h1>
<hr width ="40%">
<br>
<font size ="5">
When a surfer search anything on the browser, the browser goes to the <a  href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/what-is-dns/" style="color: white">DNS</a> server, and finds the real address of the server that the website lives on. 

The browser sends an <a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol" style="color: white">HTTP</a> request message to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to the client. 
This message, and all other data sent between the client and the server, is sent across your internet connection using <a  href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/TCP-IP" style="color: white">TCP/IP</a>. 

If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a "200 OK" message, which means website is ready, and then starts sending the website's files to the browser as a series of small chunks called data packets. 

The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete web page and displays it to you.

<h1 align = "center">What do you understand by static and dynamic web application? </h1>
<hr width ="70%">
<font size ="5">
<p><a  href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/static-vs-dynamic-website/" style="color: white">Static Website</a>:</p>
In Static Websites, Web pages are returned by the server which are prebuilt source code files built using simple languages such as HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. There is no processing of content on the server (according to the user) in Static Websites. 
Web pages are returned by the server with no change therefore, static Websites are fast. 
There is no interaction with databases. Also, they are less costly as the host does not need to support server-side processing with different languages.


<p><a  href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/static-vs-dynamic-website/" style="color: white">Dynamic Website</a>:</p>

In Dynamic Websites, Web pages are returned by the server which are processed during runtime means they are not prebuilt web pages but they are built during runtime according to the user’s demand with the help of 
server-side scripting languages such as PHP, Node.js, ASP.NET and many more supported by the server. So, they are slower than static websites but updates and interaction with databases are possible.  
Dynamic Websites are used over Static Websites as updates can be done very easily as compared to static websites (Where altering in every page is required) but in Dynamic Websites, it is possible to do a common change once and it will reflect in all the web pages.
